## OCEAN NODES is a critical component of decentralised networks supporting blockchain-based projects, often within ecosystems focused on sharing data, computing power and various other decentralised services. In short, another blockchain for AI.

Nearly $40,000,000 of investment from Fabric Ventures, DCG, IOSG Ventures.
Node requirements are 1CPU/2RAM/4SSD.

The point of the rewards is high uptime of the server (node). Every week the rewards are given out in the form of $FET tokens.

### We're going to need:
- Server on Ubuntu 22.04
- EVM wallet

Noda has been launched, congrats.

## Dashboard and uptime tracking.

To access the dashboard, write into your browser :
